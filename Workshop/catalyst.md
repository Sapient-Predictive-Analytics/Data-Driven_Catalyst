## Ensuring our Project is aligned with evolution of Project Catalyst 

We are prioritizing a lightweight, open source and interoperable [stack](https://github.com/Sapient-Predictive-Analytics/Data-Driven_Catalyst/blob/main/OSDS.md) for the data-driven reports, database, API and experimental LLM demo that are the core outputs of this project. By definition, this will allow easy integration of [Core Catalyst Governance Engine and utilities](https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-core) and provide a data feed agnostic approach that will accept json, csv, txt formats among others and allow easy transformation of data. In addition, to contribute to the evolution of Project Catalyst and have the exposure necessary to avoid duplication of efforts and streamlining of future applications such as Machine Learning, AI and data mining, we regularly share our progress via DM, email, Telegram and video meetings with Catalyst team members or ecosystem stakeholders and share our repo's URL to public Telegram channels.

During this period of providing data report "teasers" and before implementing our main infrastructure, this is quite heavy on frontend community interaction and the Milestone module, where we have received the most feedback in response to our social posts and Github [issues](https://github.com/Sapient-Predictive-Analytics/Data-Driven_Catalyst/issues).
