## Ensuring our Project is aligned with evolution of Project Catalyst 

Members of Project Catalyst, Milestone Reviewers and other community members are kindly requested to get in touch with us with inputs what they would like emphasized in our upcoming data reports, database, api and llm demo. We are especially keen on suggestions how to improve collaboration with a constantly evolving and highly resources-stretched Catalyst. Please reach out via [Issues](https://github.com/Sapient-Predictive-Analytics/Data-Driven_Catalyst/issues), [Telegram](https://t.me/DeveloperEcosystem) or [Twitter](https://x.com/SapientSwarm).

We are prioritizing a lightweight, open source and interoperable [stack](https://github.com/Sapient-Predictive-Analytics/Data-Driven_Catalyst/blob/main/OSDS.md) for the data-driven reports, database, API and experimental LLM demo that are the core outputs of this project. By definition, this will allow easy integration of Catalyst[Voices](https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-voices), and if appropriate [Core Catalyst Governance Engine and utilities](https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-core), and provide a data-feed-agnostic approach that will accept json, csv, txt formats among others and allow easy transformation of data. In addition, to contribute to the evolution of Project Catalyst, we regularly share our progress via DM, email, Telegram and video meetings with Catalyst team members or ecosystem stakeholders and share our repo's URL to public Telegram channels. This will over time build the exposure necessary to avoid duplication of efforts and streamlining of future applications such as Machine Learning, AI and data mining. Please be mindful that this is fairly difficult at the early stages of the project, where utility for potential collaborators and future users is relatively low.

During this period of providing data report "teasers" and before implementing our main infrastructure, this utility is mainly in community-facing interaction and the Milestone module, where we have received the most feedback in response to our social posts and Github [issues](https://github.com/Sapient-Predictive-Analytics/Data-Driven_Catalyst/issues).


### Keeping Voices Tech Team "in the loop"
We also reached out again to Lucio from Catalyst Voices who - like the entire Catalyst team - is currently extremely stretched and two-way communication is nearly impossible. However, sharing our repo and "checking-in" frequently ensures they are aware of our work and we are available anytime to present, share, discuss.

### Catalyst Presentation
We have also reached out to Daniel from Project Catalyst again via Telegram DM and following his suggestion in the chat requested to present to a wider Catalyst team audience chosen by their team via email. Our repository URL and ongoing developments are regularly published on public channels with 1000+ members or via DM, call etc to members of Catalyst we get in touch with.

### Office Hours
Given the difficulty of communication with the Catalyst team, we have also booked an Office Hours slot to ask questions about Catalyst developments and share progress about our project.

### Video call with Catalyst Team (Milestones Module)
On August 13th we had a call with the Catalyst Team (Ewa) to discuss our collected issues and feedback from this project regarding the Milestone Review and Milestone Module.

As you can see in the screenshot below, we shared our project ID and Github repo so the team is aware of our work. We received the Google form from them, and shared it with the repo Issues. This, along with frequent sharing of our project questions and outputs on Telegram, Twitter etc. puts the development into the public domain and increases visibility so stakeholders can easily follow the progress, get in touch, contribute or comment.
