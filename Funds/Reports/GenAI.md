Unsupervised learning is a branch of **machine learning** where the model learns patterns from **unlabeled data**. Unlike supervised learning (where you know the correct output), unsupervised learning works on data where you don’t have labels or explicit outcomes to predict.

#### **How it Works**:
- **Goal**: The model tries to identify hidden structures or patterns in the data without any predefined labels.
- **Examples of Unsupervised Learning Techniques**:
  - **Clustering**: Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity (e.g., K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering).
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while preserving the most important information (e.g., PCA – Principal Component Analysis).
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers that don’t fit into the normal data.

#### **Real-World Use Case**:
- **Customer Segmentation**: In marketing, unsupervised learning can help identify different customer groups based on their behavior, without knowing what the customer groups are in advance.

Generative AI refers to models that can generate new data that is similar to the data they were trained on. It’s part of a broader category called **generative models**, which learn the distribution of the data and can then generate new data points from that distribution.

#### **How it Works**:
- **Goal**: To create or "generate" new data based on the training data.
- **Examples of Generative AI Models**:
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, work together to create realistic data, such as images or videos.
  - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: A type of neural network that learns to compress data and then generate new data from that compressed representation.
  - **Transformer Models (GPT, BERT, etc.)**: These models, especially in language, are used to generate text, images, or even music.

#### **Real-World Use Case**:
- **Text Generation**: Models like GPT-3 can generate human-like text based on a prompt. This can be used to write articles, answer questions, or even generate creative content.

#### **Key Point**:
- **Generative AI** focuses on creating new, synthetic data that mimics the real data, often used in text, image, and video generation.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a specific application of **Generative AI** that focus on processing and generating natural language. LLMs, such as **GPT-3**, are based on **transformer architecture** and are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language.

#### **How it Works**:
- **Training**: LLMs are trained on enormous datasets of text (from books, websites, articles) using a **transformer** architecture, which allows them to understand the context and relationships between words over long sequences.
- **Goal**: To generate meaningful text based on a given prompt, answer questions, or even carry on a conversation.
  
#### **Real-World Use Case**:
- **Chatbots**: LLMs like **GPT-3** power chatbots that can understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.
- **Content Generation**: LLMs are used to generate blog posts, summarize articles, and create conversational agents.

Integrate generative AI and unsupervised learning into our current Python script for detecting cloned proposals

### Current Approach:
Our existing script uses **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** to detect cloned proposals by measuring the textual similarity between them. This is a solid foundation using unsupervised learning for proposal comparison.

### Enhancing with Generative AI:
To integrate **Generative AI**, we could build upon script in the following ways:

1. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** or **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**:
   - You could use a VAE or a GAN to generate synthetic proposals based on the features learned from the existing dataset. This will help you analyze if certain proposals are too close to artificially generated ones, indicating a lack of originality.
   
   - For example, you can train a VAE to generate text embeddings of proposals, and compare existing proposals against these generated examples. Proposals that are too close to the generated versions may indicate cloning.

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - By training a VAE to learn the normal patterns in proposal data, you can use it to detect anomalies. Proposals that significantly deviate from the generated proposal patterns (or fall within highly similar generated patterns) may be flagged as cloned or suspicious.

3. **Advanced Clustering**:
   - You could combine generative AI with clustering techniques (such as **DBSCAN** or **K-Means**) to group proposals based on their learned embeddings. Proposals within the same cluster may be more likely to be duplicates or clones.


### Suggested Generative AI and Unsupervised Learning Section

#### Generative AI Integration for Clone Detection
After identifying potential clones through TF-IDF and cosine similarity, we integrated **generative AI** techniques to enhance our analysis. A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** was trained on the proposal text to generate synthetic proposals. These generated proposals allowed us to:
   - **Compare originality**: By comparing real proposals to the generated ones, we were able to identify proposals that closely mirrored the generated samples, suggesting potential cloning.
   - **Detect anomalies**: Using the latent space representation from the VAE, we identified anomalies or unusual patterns in proposal similarities that further indicated cloning.

#### Unsupervised Learning Clustering
We then applied unsupervised learning techniques to group similar proposals into clusters. Using **DBSCAN** on the VAE-generated embeddings allowed us to detect clusters of proposals that were nearly identical. Proposals within these clusters were flagged for further manual review.
